###What Do I do after creating project based on archetype?

**Step 4 Resolving dependency in module webapps-web**

This module has dependency of **webapps-core**. The archetype has default configuration, but you must update according to your project. Check the steps:

**Steps** 

* import maven project webapps-core and webapps-web for your IDE; 
* open webapps-web/pom.xml ;
* remove webapps-core 1.0.0 of dependency (its default of archetype and it does not work for your custom structure); 
* click in add; 
* type **webapps**; 
* Choose **webapps-core** according to  **groupId** that was defined when you created the project; 

**Testing**

If you did not change any  default configuration in pom.xml of the modules, now we can test. 

1. go to parent module and execute:

```java
mvn clean install 
```

2.  now starting apps

```java
mvn tomcat:run
```

3.  Access http://localhost:8080/webapps-web/

###How to custom? What should I change? 

Update thease files according to your configuration for project, such as: data base connection, packages names etc. There are comments where you should inform data. 

* app-context.xml 

* test-context.xml
